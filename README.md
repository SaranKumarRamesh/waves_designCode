# waves_designCode
Waves_designCode" is a repository dedicated to housing the codebase for the immersive Three.js waves design used in the front-end development of my website. The repository contains JavaScript code for creating dynamic wave effects using Three.js, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of our website's design.
